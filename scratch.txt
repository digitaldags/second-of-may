Goal
Produce a polished, modern, elegant venue details experience where the Church Ceremony and Reception are separate, immersive sections, each with its own visual identity but consistent styling across the wedding theme.

Task:
Create a visually elegant, modern, wedding-themed Venue Details section with two distinct venues:

Church (Ceremony)
Reception (Wedding Dinner/Celebration)

This section should blend seamlessly with the design of the Landing page.

Design Direction:
Overall Aesthetic:
Romantic, elegant, soft wedding theme
Clean, modern serif + sans-serif pairing
Soft pastel backgrounds or subtle off-white sections
Each venue gets its own full-width block with generous padding

Section Structure:
Ceremony Section (Church)
Stands on its own, full-width
Large title: “Ceremony Venue” or “Church Ceremony”
Subtle subtitle: “Where our union begins”
Includes:
Venue name: Iglesia Ni Cristo – Locale of Pasay
Location: Pasay City, Metro Manila
Time: May 2, 2025 — Ceremony starts at 3:00 PM
Note: “Please arrive 15–20 minutes early.”
A map component (Google Maps embed)

Reception Section (Hotel)
Separate full-width block below
Slightly different background to create contrast
Title: “Reception Venue”
Subtitle: “Where we celebrate together”
Includes:
Venue name: Admiral M Gallery Hotel
Location: Roxas Boulevard, Manila
Time: “Reception immediately follows after the ceremony.”
Map component (matching styling)

Component Structure
Create two components or one component with two sections:
CeremonyVenueSection.tsx
ReceptionVenueSection.tsx
Or a single:
VenueDetails.tsx containing both sections vertically stacked

Ensure:
Full-width containers
Responsive spacing (80–140px padding top/bottom)
Soft fade-in animations on scroll
Images/maps with rounded corners + soft shadow

Technical Requirements:
Use existing styling system (Tailwind preferred)
Support mobile-first design
Maps should be responsive with an aspect ratio wrapper
Maintain consistent typography across both sections
Ensure accessibility (contrast, alt texts for decorative elements)
Export components and show sample usage inside the RSVP page
Make sure to not break any existing code
